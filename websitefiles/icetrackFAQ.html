  <h4 class = "myLabel">What information do I add to my order description?</h4>
      <p>You will want to specify the flavor, the size you want (S, M, L), and how many of each of type and size you want.
        For example, "20 Large Vanilla, 15 Small Chocolate, and 10 Medium Chocolate." would make for a clear and concise order description.
